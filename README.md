## Overview
After an initial business proposition in Hawaii, Surf n' Shake Shop, that caught the attention of a possible investor W Avy it is needed to run an analysis on the weather in order to secure sales throughout the year.

## Results
With a provided data set on the weather results in Hawaii a SQLite database was created to run statistical analysis via queries.
In an initial overview we gathered the information related with the precipitation on the island but didnÂ´t found out a constant relationship.
We run an statistical analysis on the amount of precipitation in a year

Thanks to that we identified that Oahu is a great place for the new surf shop, then a further research based on the most active station helped to determine the exact location. In which the last year temperature was mostly over 67 degrees high.

Finally  an analysis on the months of June and December was run to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable all year-round. Where we found that both average temperatures are above 71 F Degrees, just perfect for ice cream and surf on both months.

## Summary
After getting help from this Data Analysis Tools we can confirm now to the board that the weather does not represent a threat in order for the shop to operate all year-round. From the precipitation resultas that have no direct relationship to a certain month, to the average temperature being high enough for the clients to enjoy a milkshake after a nice surf ride.
